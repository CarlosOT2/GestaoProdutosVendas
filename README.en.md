<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<h3>What should I keep in mind before opening a Pull Request?</h3>

- For your <b>Pull Request</b> to be accepted, you will need to add a simple and explanatory title, following the correct files structure and format.
- This is my personal project, which I have had used as a learning experience. The code is probably inconsistent, with some decent parts and some bad parts.
